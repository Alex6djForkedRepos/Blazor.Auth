## Interactive WebAssembly

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the use cases for Blazor.Auth in a Blazor application that is currently using interactive WebAssembly render mode:

### Sign-In

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as SignIn Page
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as IUserService (Server)
participant authService as IAuthenticationService (Server)

user ->>+ page: Submit Sign-In Form
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignInAsync(signInPayload)
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService from DI<br/> and call it's `SignInAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-In endpoint
note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Client-side implementation <br/> will make an HTTP request to the server, <br/> no manual action is required.

userServiceServer ->>+ authService: SignInAsync(signInPayload)
authService ->> authService: Your server-side sign-in logic

authService -->>- userServiceServer: AuthenticationResult
userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: AuthenticationResult
note over userServiceServer,userServiceClient: Server-side implementation will <br/> return AuthenticationResult to the client#59; <br/><br/> Updated cookies will be attached <br/> to the HTTP response <br/> which will result in them being <br/> automalically stored in the user's browser.

userServiceClient -->>- page: AuthenticationResult
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon receiving AuthenticationResult from IUserService, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).
```

### Sign-Up

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as SignUp Page
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as IUserService (Server)
participant authService as IAuthenticationService (Server)

user ->>+ page: Submit Sign-Up Form
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignUpAsync(signUpPayload)
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService from DI<br/> and call it's `SignUpAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-Up endpoint
note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Client-side implementation <br/> will make an HTTP request to the server, <br/> no manual action is required.

userServiceServer ->>+ authService: SignUpAsync(signUpPayload)
authService ->> authService: Your server-side sign-up logic

authService -->>- userServiceServer: AuthenticationResult
userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: AuthenticationResult
note over userServiceServer,userServiceClient: Server-side implementation will <br/> return AuthenticationResult to the client#59; <br/><br/> Updated cookies will be attached <br/> to the HTTP response <br/> which will result in them being <br/> automalically stored in the user's browser.

userServiceClient -->>- page: AuthenticationResult
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon receiving AuthenticationResult from IUserService, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).
```

### Sign-Out

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

actor user as User
participant page as Page
participant userServiceClient as IUserService (Client)
participant userServiceServer as IUserService (Server)

user ->>+ page: Initiate Sign-Out
page ->>+ userServiceClient: SignOutAsync()
note over page,userServiceClient: Resolve IUserService from DI<br/> and call it's `SignOutAsync` method.
userServiceClient ->>+ userServiceServer: HTTP request to Sign-Out endpoint
note over userServiceClient,userServiceServer: Client-side implementation will <br/> make an HTTP request to the server, <br/> no manual action is required.

userServiceServer -->> userServiceClient: HTTP OK
note over userServiceServer,userServiceClient: Blazor.Auth will remove <br/> the user's authentication cookies <br/> by marking them as expired <br/> in the HTTP response.

userServiceClient -->>- page: #32;
page -->>- user: Continue, <br/> e.g. redirect to home page, <br/> or other custom logic

note over user,userServiceClient: Upon sign-out process completion, <br/> do a page refresh in order to refresh the User's AuthenticationState<br/><br/> Example: NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/", true).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Add this nuget package to your **Server** project:

```
dotnet add package BitzArt.Blazor.Auth.Server
```

Add this nuget package to your **Client** project:

```
dotnet add package BitzArt.Blazor.Auth.Client
```

### Configuration

Call this method in both your **Server** `Program.cs` and **Client** `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.AddBlazorAuth();
```

### Usage

You can now use Blazor [authorization capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security) (such as `@attribute [Authorize]`, `AuthorizeView`, `AuthorizeRouteView`) as you normally would.

## Use Cases

While your end soultion code regarding authentication remains the same, the way Blazor.Auth behaves under the hood may vary depending on your current render mode. 

The following segments will guide you through the most common use-cases such as Sign-In, Sign-Up and Sign-Out and show you how to implement them in your Blazor application. 

More detailed diagrams are organized according to different Blazor interactivity types:

- [Static SSR](04.use-cases/01.static-ssr.md)
- [Interactive WebAssembly](04.use-cases/02.interactive-webassembly.md)
- [Interactive Server](04.use-cases/03.interactive-server.md) 

### Refresh Token

On every `GetAuthenticationStateAsync` call to `AuthenticationStateProvider`, it will check if the current access token is expired. If it is, the user's JWT Pair will automatically be refreshed.

For a more in-depth overview of this process, refer to the [Architecture](05.architecture.md) section.
